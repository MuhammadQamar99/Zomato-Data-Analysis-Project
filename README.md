# Zomato Data Analysis Project
This project analyzes a dataset of Zomato restaurants to extract insights on customer behavior, restaurant types, ratings, and spending habits. The analysis was conducted using Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

📊 Features of the Analysis
Data Cleaning:

Processed the rate column to extract numerical values.
Checked for and handled null values.
Key Insights:

Type of Restaurants: Majority of the customers prefer dining restaurants.
Maximum Votes: Dining restaurants received the highest votes.
Rating Distribution: Most restaurants received ratings between 3.5 to 4.
Average Order Spending: Approximate spending for two people is around ₹300.
Online vs Offline Ratings:
Online orders tend to receive better ratings compared to offline.
Dining restaurants attract most offline customers, while cafes dominate online orders.
Visualizations:

Count plots, histograms, line plots, and heatmaps were used to present data trends and insights effectively.
🛠️ Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For static visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced visualizations.
